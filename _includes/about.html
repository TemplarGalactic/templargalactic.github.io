                <h2>About Templar Crypto Systems</h2>
                <p>Templar Crpto Systems came about when we noticed the lack of open source controllers for the space sim market </p>
                <p>For the most part the only comerical available controllers are HOTAS systems, heyboard/mouse, or game console controllers, we wanted something diffrent</p>
                <p>This is what spawned the Flight System MK.1, a 25 button, 5 toggle switch controller, that when paired with a joystick allows for a unique flight experience.</p>
                <p>The controller is currently in the protype stage, with a Kickstarter campagin comming in the next few weeks</p>
